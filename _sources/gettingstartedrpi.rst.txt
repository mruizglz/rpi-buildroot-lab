Getting started with RPI
========================

This document describes the essential steps students have to follow to
boot the Raspberry Pi with a Linux-based distribution such as Raspberry
PI OS. After performing the operating system installation, the student
must investigate the software tools installed and their potential.
Finally, the student must implement a software application that measures
3D acceleration using a transducer. The following variants of
application are proposed to the student:

1. Develop a simple console program developed in the C language.

2. (Optional) Develop an equivalent application using Python.


.. note::

    **[Time to complete the laboratory]:** The time necessary to complete steps 1 to 3 in this tutorial is approximately 4 hours.

Operating System Installation
-----------------------------

Downloading and installing Raspberry PI OS 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several Linux and Android distributions can be installed on the
Raspberry Pi platform. These Operating System distributions also include
multiple software applications and tools such as text editors, music
players, video editing and playing, games, development tools, etc.

Follow the steps below to install the Raspbian Operating System:

1) Download the `Raspberry PI Imager <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_ tool for your specific OS.

2) Execute the application, and a window will be displayed (see :numref:`imagermain`). First choose
   the Raspberry PI hardware (see :numref:`imagerhw`) and then, choose the Operating System (see :numref:`imageros`) 
   and Storage options (CHOOSE STORAGE) to burn an SD card with the
   Raspberry PI OS 32 bits version. Click on the NEXT button and you
   will have the options (see :numref:`imagersettings`, :numref:`imagergeneral`, :numref:`imagerservices`, :numref:`imageroptions`) to apply your specific customization (**enable
   SSH**, Username (rpi-student) and Password (rpi) , WIFI SSID and passkey, and your
   keyboard language configuration). Save the configuration and continue to write
   the micro SD Card.

.. warning::

   **[VERY IMPORTANT]:** Be careful in the destination device    where the image is burned because this information is not    recoverable 

3) Wait until the program ends writing the SD Card **(this can take up
   to one hour depending on your SD card category and model)**.

Setting up the Raspberry Pi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to interact with the Raspberry Pi for the activities described
in this document. There are three ways to establish this interaction:

-  The easiest one is connecting an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a
   USB mouse. This configuration allows us to use the Raspberry Pi as we
   would with a regular computer. Once the RPI is booted, we can set the
   WiFi connections and other settings such as enable the use of a
   serial line.

-  Opening an SSH session between your computer and the Raspberry Pi
   without connecting additional peripherals. This kind of configuration
   is known as headless start (use the `rpi-student` login).

-  Use the serial USB-TTL cable that you need to connect to the GPIO
   expansion connector. This requires first to enable the serial line in
   the Raspberry PI OS using the `raspi-config <https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#list-of-options>`_ tool.
   The connection of the USB-TTL cable is depicted in :numref:`rpiwithconnector`.

.. note..

   **[VERY IMPORTANT]:** In the UPM lab, there is no option to  connect the RPI to the ethernet cabled network; only a      
   dedicated WIFI (with no internet connection) is available  (SSID: RPI)

Reviewing the SD card content 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Plug in the SD card into the computer.

2) You should now see one new drive in the System Explorer (Windows)/Nautilus (Ubuntu)
   named "boot". In Linux you will see two partitions mounted in your
   system. Open the partition/unit identified as "boot".


.. note::

     **[VERY IMPORTANT]:** This is the partition used by          Raspberry to make the necessary hardware configuration before starting the operating system. Beware of not    deleting or modifying files other than those described in this  manual, or the Raspberry may not boot.  


3) List the content of the boot partition (FAT32) and identify the files
   as in :numref:`usdcardfat` (Ubuntu Linux).

Booting the RPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Insert the SD card and connect the power supply and all other cables
needed. The first time you boot your RPI you will see how the RPI is
configured (this information is only displayed in the HDMI monitor) and
rebooted. Wait 1 or 2 minutes (this depends again on your SD card
category) until the RPI is completely booted.

.. note::

    **[Security]:** Having the default user and password supposes a security issue, more if the SSH sessions are enabled. You can always change the password by executing the command passwd once logged in.  

Discovering the RPI IP address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To open an SSH session from your computer to the Raspberry Pi you need
to know its IP address. There are multiple ways to discover the
Raspberry Pi IP address:

a) Use an `IP Scanner utility <https://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner>`_, 
   and scan in the range of your network. For example, you can quickly identify a
   Raspberry Pi as they use the hostname "raspberrypi.local" by default.
   This tool cannot be used at the UPM lab.
   
b) If you know your Raspberry Pi MAC address, you can set the DHCP
   server to assign a static IP to the Raspberry Pi MAC. This is
   typically done in the router configuration. Please, consider that
   Ethernet and WiFi ports have different MAC addresses. In the
   laboratory, your Raspberry can have only a dynamically assigned IP in
   the WIFI network with SSID RPI (ask your instructor to verify the
   configuration). 

c) You could open an RS232 serial connection in the Raspberry Pi GPIO
   ports and use the command line (`ifconfig` command) to obtain the IP or
   set the desired IP and netmask.


Raspberry Pi OS Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update and upgrade the OS if you have an internet connection.
Please, do not update the OS during the classes, as this operation will
require some time. You can update the OS by running the following
commands:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: RPI OS update
    
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt upgrade
    
    

Integration of a 3-axis accelerometer with Raspberry-Pi 
-------------------------------------------------------

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The student must investigate functions and commands and implement a C
program to get the following requirements:

1. Show the values of the 3-axis acceleration obtained from the MPU-6000
   I2C sensor.

2. The measurement readings are shown every 3 seconds.

Suggested Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Analyses the problem of offsets in the values returned. Define and
   implement a method to get corrected values

-  Get stop the program if "CRTL-C" is typed.


Optional: Python Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For advanced students, the implementation of this exercise in Python is
proposed. For this, you can use any of the multiple Python modules that
gain access to I2C interface in the Raspberry Pi.

Compiling & linking C program in Linux
-----------------------------------------------

In Linux, C/c++ programs are compiled and linked using the "make"
command. This command searches a "Makefile". A "Makefile" is a text file
with the necessary information to compile and link and must be in the
same directory of *myprogram.c*. The result will be *myprogram.o* and
*myprogram* (executable).

.. code-block:: Makefile
   :caption: Detail Makefile

   DEBUG= -O2 #Debugging Level

   CC= gcc #Compiler command
   INCLUDE= -I/usr/local/include #Include directory
   CFLAGS= $(DEBUG) -Wall $(INCLUDE) -Winline #Compiler Flags
   LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/lib #Linker Flags

   LIBS= -lpthread -lm #Libraries used if needed

   SRC = myprogram.c

   OBJ 	= $(SRC:.c=.o)
   BIN 	= $(SRC:.c=)

   $(BIN):	 $(OBJ)
   	@echo [link] $@
   	$(CC) -o $@ $< $(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)
   .c.o:
   	@echo [Compile] $<
   	$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

   clean:
   	@rm -f $(OBJ) $(BIN)

Questions to be reported to instructors
-------------------------------------------------

1. Explain the content of the `config.txt` file in the FAT32 partition of the uSDCARD of your RPI

2. How the I2C interface is enabled? Is there any change in the
   config.txt file?

3. Could you describe the commands used to compile a C/C++ program in
   Linux?

4. What is a library? What is the difference between a static and a
   shared library?

5. Summarize the utility of the `makefile` file and the make command.

6. What is the preferred utility to debug a C program in Linux?

7. How can you obtain the serial number of your Raspberry Pi? Is there
   any relation between the serial number and the MAC address?
